        <P>“Hello, It is my pleasure to recommend Jason Page. I have
        known him for one year in my capacity as Food and Beverage Director at
        Eldora Mountain Resort. Jason worked for me in various roles as an
        intern, and based on his work, I would rank him as one of the best
        interns we’ve had in the program. Jason distinguished himself by
        consistently showing strong leadership skills and taking the time to
        teach his peers. He came to work each day on time and with a great
        attitude.
        
        Jason is highly intelligent and has superb analytical and
        communication skills. If his performance in our company is a good
        indication of how he would perform in yours, he would be an extremely
        positive asset to your program.
        
       If I can be of any further assistance,
        or provide you with any additional information, please do not hesitate
        to contact me at the email address listed below. Yours Sincerely,”</P>
